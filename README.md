# Aloha tool

The designing of this tool was an exercise for Becode.org.
The goal was to design a CLI-tool using de [pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#BreachesForAccount) and style it with our own taste.
I used other packages such as : figlet, ora, chalk-rainbow, axios, email-validator.


##  To install it :

go to your terminal

``` $ npm install @lau-bel/aloha ```

##  To use it :

``` $ aloha [insert your email] ```


##  Result :

If your email was on a website which had been breached the tool refers to you the name, date and description of it.


Have a nice day.
