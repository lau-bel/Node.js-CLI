# Aloha tool

The designing of this tool was an exercise for Becode.org. 
The goal was to designing Ã  CLI-tool using de [pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#BreachesForAccount) and stylish it with our own tastes. 
I used other packages as : figlet, ora, chalk-rainbow, axios, validator, args.


## H2 To install it :

go to your terminal

``` $ npm install @lau-bel/Aloha ```

## H2 To use it :

``` $ aloha [insert your email] ```


## H2 Result :

If you had some breach the tool refers you the Name, date and description of it.


Have a nice day.
